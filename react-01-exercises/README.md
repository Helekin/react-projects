## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the Udemy course "React y TypeScript - La Guía Completa Creando +10 Proyectos" by Juan Pablo De la torre Valdez. The course was last updated in March 2025, nd these exercises are designed to help you master modern React development with TypeScript, covering everything from foundational concepts to advanced techniques used in real-world applications.

You'll learn to create and manage complete React projects, work with essential hooks like useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, and useReducer, and build your own custom hooks. The repository includes practices with React Hook Form for form handling, Zod for API validation, and Headless UI for interactive components. You’ll implement multi-page routing using React Router DOM, build FullStack apps with the PERN and MERN stacks, and manage backends with Express, Sequelize, Mongoose, and Prisma. Additionally, you'll add authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and enhance data fetching with React Query.
